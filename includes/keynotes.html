		<p>	<a href="https://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/mhb0.html" target="_blank">Mark H. Bickhard</a> is the Henry R. Luce Professor of Cognitive Robotics and the Philosophy of Knowledge and Director of The Institute of Interactivist Studies at Lehigh University. His interests are in theoretical philosophy and theoretical psychology, and all related subjects, and is the pre-eminent figure in Interactivism. His interactive model of representation has deep implications concerning the fundamental importance of robotics and autonomous agents and the differentiation of those fields from standard artificial intelligence and cognitive science approaches. The model has applications ranging from the design of autonomous agents to the understanding of central nervous system processes, and implications for the modeling of learning and development, motivation, memory, rational thought, emotions, and consciousness. Representation permeates all psychological phenomena, and so also, therefore, does an alternative model of representation permeate all areas concerned with psychological phenomena.

<h2>Joanna Rączaszek-Leonardi</h2>


<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OPggSAYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Joanna Rączaszek-Leonardi</a> is a professor at the Institute of Psychology (Psycholinguistics Lab) at the Polish Academy of Sciences and at the Faculty of Psychology University of Warsaw where she heads Human Interactivity and Language Lab.

She works to develop an approach to language as a system of replicable constraints, exerting controlling influences on multiple time-scales (e.g., on-line, developmental, cultural, evolutionary) and multiple systems (e.g., human interaction, individual cognition). In her papers she strives to integrate an ecological psychology approach to how action and co-action shapes cognition with a semiotic approach to types of signification and with dynamical systems methods for studying communication and coordination.
