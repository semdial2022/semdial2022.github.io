<h2> Call for Papers</h2>
<article class="blog-post">

<p>DubDial will be the 26th edition of the SemDial workshop series, which aims to bring together researchers working on the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue in fields such as formal semantics and pragmatics, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. This year, there will be a guiding theme for the conference: interactivism.

<p>The Interactivist model (Bickhard, 2009) offers a new dynamic approach to understanding language, communication, and cognition. Across many disciplines, from philosophy to neuroscience and robotics, there is recognition that explanations of life and mind need to be grounded in the physics of far-from-equilibrium, interactive systems. From this starting point, explanations have been developed for phenomena ranging from representation, perception, and action to motivation, memory, learning and development, emotions, consciousness, rationality, sociality, personality and psychopathology. This work has yet to develop interfaces with studies of specific phenomena in dialogue modelling and our purpose is to open the discussion on how dialogue researchers can take advantage of this and related perspectives like Enactivism and Ecological Psychology.

			<p>We welcome submissions on this special theme of Interactivism and we continue to welcome any papers with formal, computational and empirical approaches to the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue, including, but not limited to:
