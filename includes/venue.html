<h2>Travelling to Dublin</h2>
<article class="blog-post">

<p>Dublin is serviced by most major airlines – there are 44 connecting to 180 destinations – and has a busy international airport located about 12kms north of the city centre. There are two adjacent terminals but both have similar facilities for transport to the city.

<p>If there are no direct flights to Dublin, connections can be made through any of the London airports and most European capitals.

<p>Dublin also offers pre-clearance through US customs and immigration which allows faster transfers to domestic and international connections when landing in the States.

<p>Please check visa requirements for travelling to Ireland here:
<a href="https://www.dfa.ie/travel/visas/visas-for-ireland/">https://www.dfa.ie/travel/visas/visas-for-ireland/</a>

<p>Entry requirements relating to Covid restrictions are available here:

<p><b>Getting from the airport</b></br>
<br>On arrival at Dublin airport, you can choose from buses, taxi, or hire a car to get you into the city centre.

<p><b>Buses</b>
<br/>
<br>The cheapest way to get to the city centre is by either of the two bus services, with return tickets cheaper than single purchases.</br>

<br>Both services have multiple routes so check online to find which will take you closest to your hotel. You should also ask the driver who should let you know which is the closest stop.</br>

<p><b>Airlink</b> (run by Dublin Bus) – <a href="https://dodublin.ie/airport-transfers/airlink-express/tickets">https://dodublin.ie/airport-transfers/airlink-express/tickets</a>  Serves as a hub for airport transfers. Tickets can be purchased in a variety of ways, including online or in cash from the driver. See the website for details.

<p><b>Aircoach</b> – <a href="https://www.aircoach.ie/">https://www.aircoach.ie/</a>
You can buy tickets: online; from the Aircoach staff member at departure stand at both terminals; from the driver using cash or contactless payment.

<p><b>Taxis</b>
<br/>
<br>There are taxi ranks outside both terminals. Follow the signs.

<br/>

<br>The cost will be dependent on traffic and whether you are staying on the northside or southside of the river but should be about €30-€40. Note: Many taxi drivers do not take cards – or claim they don’t – so either ask or be sure to have about €50 in cash. There are ATMs inside the terminal.

<br/>

<br>Please note that Uber, Lyft and other ride-sharing platforms are not available in Dublin. You can download the Free Now app but this will provide only accredited taxi drivers and is not necessarily cheaper: <a href="https://free-now.com/ie/welcome-passenger">https://free-now.com/ie/welcome-passenger</a>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>
<article class="blog-post">

<p>Dublin has a wide variety of accommodation of different price ranges and types in the immediate area around TUD. We recommend using sites such as booking.com, airbnb.com and other sites to find the best accommodation for you depending on your budget and needs, e.g. <a href="https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaFCIAQGYAQm4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQuIAgGoAgO4Ap2RppYGwAIB0gIkYmYyMmI5MDgtZjEwNi00NjlkLWJlNDgtODFiM2JlZWRkMmUw2AIG4AIB&sid=29ac8d0b1085155e7d8ba341b321840c&aid=304142&ss=Technological+University+Dublin+-+Grangegorman%2C+Grangegorman+Lower%2C+Dublin+7%2C+Ireland&ssne=Technological+University+Dublin+-+Grangegorman%2C+Grangegorman+Lower%2C+Dublin+7%2C+Ireland&ssne_untouched=Technological+University+Dublin+-+Grangegorman%2C+Grangegorman+Lower%2C+Dublin+7%2C+Ireland&lang=en-gb&src=searchresults&checkin=2022-08-21&checkout=2022-08-25&group_adults=2&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&sb_travel_purpose=leisure&nflt=pri%3D2%3Bpri%3D3" target="_blank">booking.com search for 21st-25th August</a>.

<p>SemDial 2022 is not recommending, promoting or contracted with any Dublin hotel or hostel. All reservations must be individually made by conference attendees.
Dublin is well-serviced with hotels, BnBs, hostels, and AirBnB options so it should be possible to find something to suit any budget.
 
<p>Also, note that the Dublin Tram system (called Luas) has two lines the red and green line (see: https://luas.ie/map/ ). The Grangegorman stop on the Green line and the Smithfield stop on the red line are both within 5/10 minutes walk from the venue. So it may be that finding a hotel near either of this tram lines would be a suitable option for you.

<p>More generally some of the areas in Dublin near Grangegorman where you might find hotels include: Parnell Square, O’Connell Street, Smithfield, or Stoney Batter.
